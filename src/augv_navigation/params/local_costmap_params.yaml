  # why does it not work with odom???? #transform delays??
  # Reasons
  # 1. robot_state_publisher -> interferes with ekf tf publish. Shutting this down leads to the robot generating plans but still produces errors.
  # 2. base frame mismatch b/w global and local planners. This requires conversion from local to global frame (leading to errors)
  # 3. Increasing publish frequency of the EKF nodes helps, but produces errors.
  # 4. transform tolerance does not help.
